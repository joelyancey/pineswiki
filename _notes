To refresh site:
gunicorn-restart # (sudo systemctl restart gunicorn)

pip cache purge

To activate django environment:
  source .venv/bin/activate

Configure nginx location to serve static files by:
  1. editing /etc/nginx/sites-available/django-wiki with elevated permissions
  2. run: sudo systemctl restart nginx

If site is transferred to another server, django-wiki requires the following installations:
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg-dev libpng12-0 libpng12-dev


To recreate environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install django gunicorn psycopg2-binary Jinja2
cd django-wiki
pip install -e .
NOTE: /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service must point to exact path to gunicorn

After changes to database schema, must run (with env activated):
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

To view console output (logging, prints), run server as follows:
  python manage.py runserver

To check gunicorn status:
  sudo systemctl status gunicorn

.service file for gunicorn systemctl daemon is located here:
  /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

Nginx config file location:
  /etc/nginx/sites-available/django-wiki
  After modifying this file, run: sudo systemctl restart nginx


/etc/nginx/sites-enabled contains a symlink to the site's nginx config in /etc/nginx/sites-available:
  django-wiki -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/django-wiki

The following logs may be helpful:

Check the Nginx process logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u nginx
Check the Nginx access logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/access.log
Check the Nginx error logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/error.log
Check the Gunicorn application logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u gunicorn
Check the Gunicorn socket logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u gunicorn.socket

sudo tail -F /var/log/nginx/error.log

____ Using Django ____
Documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/

Style...
To collect the static files into STATIC_ROOT, run:
  pythonn manage.py collectstatic
  Or, 
  python manage.py collectstatic --clear 
  #findstatic only checks whether timestamps on static files have changed
  #therefore, use '--clear' if you change INSTALLED_APPS

____ Using Nginx ____
In Nginx, /etc/nginx/sites-available stores all your website configuration files, while /etc/nginx/sites-enabled contains symbolic links to those files in /etc/nginx/sites-available. The sites-available directory holds the configuration files for all potential websites, and sites-enabled determines which sites are currently active and being served.
